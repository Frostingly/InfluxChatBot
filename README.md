# InfluxChatBot

Discord bot for the Hypixel guild "Influx"

This bot was created by Frostingly, there was an old bot made by Cqptain, but that was written in JavaScript, this is a more lightweight version written in TypeScript, if you'd like to contribute to the project, you can fork it and make any changes you'd like, of course if you'll try to publish any malicious code, I'll simply block every single attempt.

## üòç Release

So far this project is really only for the guild, but I might make an update where it can be used on other discord servers as well.

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to contribute?

Want to help out the guild, even if you're an outsider? Awesome! There are things that I don't know how to make and any amount of help will be greatly appreciated.

1. Press "Fork" button top right of the main github repo page.
2. Press "Code" button more near the top and to the left of the main github repo page.
3. Press HTTPS, and click copy.
4. Open the terminal and go to any location where you want to save the project to your local machine.
5. Run `git clone <URL>`

Boom! You're done, you now have a copy of the project on your local machine, now you'll be able to commit changes to your own GitHub repo and then be able to make a pull request to the project.

## üìù To-do

This project is built on Discord.js v13 update and we want to take advantage of the update and as such we would need a Slash commands handler, as well as an events handler for any future updates that could make the bot more versatile in more situations.
